# cpanel-composer-installer-php
This PHP script installs and runs Composer on Cpanel hosting. Due to the restricted SSH access on Cpanel hosting, this script can serve as an alternative solution for running Composer on these hosting services. Using the shell_exec function in PHP, this script can automatically install Composer and provide the execution of it for Cpanel users.
